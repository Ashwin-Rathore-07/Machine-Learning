## Machine-Learning

Hands-on machine learning practice repository containing exploratory data analysis (EDA), concept-wise implementations, from-scratch algorithms, and experiments while learning Machine Learning from fundamentals to advanced techniques.

This repository contains my hands-on practice, notes, and implementations covering the complete Machine Learning pipeline — from data understanding to model evaluation.

### Topics Covered
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
- Linear and Polynomial Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Gradient Descent and Optimization Techniques
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Ensemble Methods (Bagging, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical)
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
- Model Evaluation (ROC Curve, AUC, Precision-Recall, Cross-Validation)
- Bias-Variance Tradeoff

### Goal
To build strong conceptual understanding of end-to-end Machine Learning, from raw data exploration to robust model building, using clean implementations and real experiments.

### Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

### Status
🚧 Actively updating
