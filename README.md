Machine-Learning

Hands-on machine learning practice repository containing exploratory data analysis (EDA), concept-wise implementations, from-scratch algorithms, and experiments while learning Machine Learning from fundamentals to advanced techniques.

This repository contains my hands-on practice, notes, and implementations covering the complete Machine Learning pipeline — from data understanding to model evaluation.

Topics Covered

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Linear & Polynomial Regression

Logistic Regression

Gradient Descent & Optimization Techniques

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Trees

Ensemble Methods (Bagging, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical)

Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

Model Evaluation (ROC Curve, AUC, Precision–Recall, Cross-Validation)

Bias–Variance Tradeoff

Goal

To build strong conceptual understanding of end-to-end Machine Learning, from raw data exploration to robust model building, using clean implementations and real experiments.
